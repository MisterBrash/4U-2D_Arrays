This is practice with 2D arrays. Check with classmates and then your teacher to see if you have it working correctly.

Write your code in [`script.js`](../script.js). Complete in the order presented:

- Create the function `new_2d(rows, cols, filler)`.  This function creates a new 2d array of height `rows` and width `cols`, all filled with `filler`.  
**For Example:**
  ```JS
  let zeros = new_2d(4, 3, 0);
  console.log(zeros);
  > [ [0,0,0],
      [0,0,0],
      [0,0,0],
      [0,0,0] ]
  ```
  
<br> 

- Create the function `random_2d(rows, cols, min, max)`. This function creates a 2d array of height `rows` and width `cols`, where each element is a random number from `min` to `max`. `randInt()` is already in the [script file](../script.js).  

<br>

- Create the function `length_2d(arr)` that assumes the input is a 2D array and and _returns_ the total number of elements.  
**For Example:**
  ```JS
  length_2d([[3,5,7,9], [4, 2], [5, 7, 8, 6], [6]]);
  > 11
  ```
<br>

- Create the function `print_2d(arr)` that assumes the input is a 2D array and prints to the console with **each column (element) separated by a tab** (**`\t`**) and **each row on a new line**. Note - it might not be a _square_ array (cols != rows).  
**For Example:**
  ```JS
  print_2d([[1,0,1],[0,1],[1,3,1],[0,0,0]]);
  1   0   1
  0   1  
  1   3   1
  0   0   0
  ```  
  **The above function (`print_2d()`) is necessary for a future assessment so make sure it works as expected!**  

<br>

- Create the function `hide_waldo(rows, cols)` that creates a new 2d array `cols` wide and `rows` tall. It will randomly hide the string "waldo" amongst a bunch of random integers or emoticons or whatever you choose. Your function will _return_ the 2d array. 

<br>

- Create the function `wheres_waldo(arr)`. This function looks for the string "waldo" inside the given 2d array and returns his location as a 2-element array `[row, col]` (or `[]` if he's never found).  
**For Example:**
  ```JS
  let puzzle = [[0,1,"hi",-1],[9,4,3, "waldo", "not waldo"], [0,0,0,0,0,0]];
  
  console.log(wheres_waldo(puzzle));
  [1, 3]    // He's in the fourth position of the second array
  ```

If done correctly, you should be able to run `wheres_waldo(hide_waldo(10, 8))` and your code should hide and then find him!

Don't forget to test your functions - you'll need some `console.log()` to see the returns.
